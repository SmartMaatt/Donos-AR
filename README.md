The application has been crafted with a blend of humor and technology, aiming to engage users in a playful experience while demonstrating the advanced features of AR.

- **Realistic Movements:** The character approaches the user with life-like animations.

### Humorous Interaction
- **Action Choices:** Users are presented with two humorous options: "Call the Police" or "File an Expulsion Request".
